# Sneaky Aliens

My first JS project! This is a hidden movement game where some players are trying to escape a derelict spaceship (or whatever you prefer to imagine, it's abstracted), and other players try to hunt them down and kill them.

It was built from a fork Socket.io's chat-example in a very general sense.
That project can be found here:

And if you want, consider buying the print&play from the original creators:
